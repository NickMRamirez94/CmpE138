# Database Project for CmpE138

The primary users for this system will be people who want to secure their homes further
to mitigate risk to their property and monitor their homes through a security company. The
security company will allow for surveillance using a security camera for one’s home and other
additional security features that can be added to a user’s personal security network. The company
also allows for expanded security through connecting your personal camera security feed with
neighbors in the same area, which expands a user’s personal security knowledge of the
surrounding area.

between the security company, security user, security features available, home security, one’s
personal security network, and the overall security network. This application/ DB aims to show
